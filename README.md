# MyFirstCalculator

This project was developed as part of the EBAC Data Science course.

Using my initial studies in Python, I combined various elements of the language, including conditionals, arithmetic operations, and the `print`, `break`, and `input` functions.

The objective of this project was to create a simple calculator that operates in a loop, supporting the four basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
